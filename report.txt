Part-A -> estimator.py

We have implemented particle filtering algorithm to calculate the required probability distribution. 


Part-B -> intelligentDriver.py

We have implemented a BFS based search for the goal state to ensure that the car moves in a directed way to reach the checkpoints. Also, we use the given belief distribution to minimise the chances of collisions with other cars.
